            <h1>On the Implications and Functionalities of Digital Libraries</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Many times, over many millennia have we lost bountiful sets of knowledge.
                    Countless stories exist for the declines of Alexandria, Timbuktu, Pergamum, and
                    the House of Wisdom. As a species we have gone through two identifiable dark
                    ages, but far more information has been lost during times of light than we can
                    track. Such examples are the governments who deem it fit to destroy, restrict,
                    and remove books that go against their political agenda. The Nazis, Communists,
                    and even modern-day United States. Therefore, we arrive at a thought experiment
                    where we wish to thwart these attempts of forced arrogance.</p>
                <p>Immediately, this blog might draw parallels in your mind to works like Fahrenheit
                    451 and 1984. This isn’t without purpose, as in seeing the path we are apart of
                    can encourage you to take stand and to perhaps engage in our universal think
                    tank. In ways that I push you towards the above-mentioned books, I will also
                    point you towards two resources from which I draw parts of this idea, namely <a
                        href="https://www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        class="externalLink">The Gutenberg Project</a>, <a
                        href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" class="externalLink">Perseus Digital Library</a>,
                    and <a href="http://melvillesmarginalia.org/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" class="externalLink">Melville’s Marginalia</a>.
                    These resources were created for various reasons, but all exist as digital
                    libraries of texts. The idea that I aim to propose here is in most similarity to
                    that of The Gutenberg Project. Simply, it aims to create a shared library of
                    eBooks that are accessible by all. In fact, the first eBook ever created was
                    done by the creator of The Gutenberg Project and was of the United States
                    Declaration of Independence. </p>
            </section>
            <section>

                <h2>Implications</h2>
                <p>Now that I have injected the idea of a digital library into your conscious, we
                    can begin to dissect their uses and how they might be of assistance in our
                    shared dilemma. The benefits to be gained from digital libraries is simple. Once
                    hosted on the web, a resource such as these is accessible by anyone with a
                    connection to the internet. While not quite universal, this is already a large
                    step in allowing swaths of knowledge to be replicated the world over and
                    accessible by all it’s denizens.</p>
                <p>However, a few problems arise with the creation of such a tool. Firstly, we must
                    reel in or accept the large scope of text that we would have to save. With quick
                    research, we arrive at two pieces of information; the average size of a book is
                    liberally estimated to be 1 MB (Megabyte) and the largest library in the world
                    is The Library of Congress which contains 164 million items (Only 25 million of
                    which are cataloged books and 74.5 million are manuscripts). If we take a more
                    conservative approach and estimate that each book is instead 5 MB, then to store
                    the entire Library of Congress would take approximately 780 TB (Terabyte) of
                    space. While to any layman, this seems like an incredibly large amount of data,
                    it would account for only .000078% of Google’s estimated storage capacity.
                    Meaning, that Google could store the human collective of literature 1.28 million
                    times. So, while the task of storage is a problem for a singular person, if we
                    take in account the abilities of entities, then the storage of our library
                    becomes a cheap trick. Perhaps, however, we would like to be completely
                    independent in our storage, then we could still create our own storage solution
                    with 4 TB drives from Seagate for about $19,500<sup><a href="#i"
                            class="internalLink">i</a></sup>.</p>
                <p>The second problem that we run into is far harder to surpass. Collecting all our
                    works and turning them into eBooks. All the aforementioned resources have
                    scanned their texts so that they are simple pdf files and can be searched for
                    strings of text<sup><a href="#ii" class="internalLink">ii</a></sup>. The sheer
                    amount of people you would need dedicated to this task would be insurmountable
                    on its own, but you also must ensure that each scanned work is allowed to exist
                    on your server. While it’s nice to assume every author and publisher would wish
                    to contribute their work to the collective human conscious, many are greedy and
                    would need compensation of some form. For the Perseus Digital Library and
                    Melville’s Marginalia, this problem is nonexistent as all the works they contain
                    are either out of copyright or are transformative enough. Gutenberg relies on
                    the works being out of copyright or the generous donation of works by
                    artists/the publishing of the books on Gutenberg. There isn’t an easy way to get
                    around this problem, and the most effective way would be to take the same action
                    as any digital library with borrowing features and buy licenses from the
                    publishers.</p>
                <p>A third problem arises in two ways; thus, we will break it into two smaller
                    problems. Firstly, how should we allow for the growth of our library? It is
                    simple to say that for any new literature that is created, we will add it.
                    Passing the first two problems that we have already enumerated; we ask what is
                    determined to be a piece of literature? Is every email, sentence, and comment on
                    a YouTube video literature? You might not think that it is, but perhaps some
                    emails contain information that would be helpful to a large portion of people.
                    They might contain in-depth explanations on important topics, news around the
                    world, and interesting approaches to problems. These pieces of information would
                    often be nice to keep, but who decides their worth, and how are they added to
                    our library? So, to summarize, the first part of our third problem is that,
                    while our work can grow, what do we categorize as a worthy piece of literature.
                    The second part of our problem then follows, who decides the answer to this
                    question? The only option that we might have to this is to hire a team of
                    moderators for our library, librarians for their namesake, and allow them to be
                    the discerners. You could distinguish further problems from this final one, but
                    for the sake of this essay we will make the argument that these are the three
                    that we choose to deal with.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Functionalities</h2>
                <p>Now that we have gone over the problems that are going to stand in the way of our
                    digital library, we can begin to address the functionalities that we wish for it
                    to have. There are three objective that we aim to meet in functionality. First,
                    we want to ensure that our library is accessible anywhere. Second, we want it to
                    be accessible anytime. Finally, we want it to be always available.</p>
                <p>The immediate answer to allowing access anywhere is a technology that we already
                    have. The internet. To address concern, I do realize that not everyone, possibly
                    not even a majority of the world, have access to reliable semi-respondent
                    internet connections<sup><a href="#iii" class="internalLink">iii</a></sup>. This
                    is not the concern of this paper, however, and we approach this topic from the
                    idea that the world has already achieved perfect communication and we must now
                    protect it from reverting. If, however, this piece encourages you to advocate
                    for general better access to information across the globe, then I will consider
                    my goal as thoroughly completed as the main purpose of my original notion.
                    Perhaps, with the creation of Elon Musk’s Starlink, there will be widespread
                    access to internet across the globe quite soon.</p>
                <p>Of course, with the growing ability for us to store more vast amounts of
                    information, we could instead propose a sneakernet<sup><a href="#iv"
                            class="internalLink">iv</a></sup> of sorts. In theory, we could then use
                    either small portable USB devices like thumb drives or continue with the idea of
                    hard/solid drives. If we would prefer for our sneakernet to want to move fast
                    and without much suspicion, which for our proposed idea could perhaps be useful
                    in the case of an attempted overthrow of human knowledge, then we would use the
                    small thumb drives. The largest of these thumb drives that I have seen is 1 TB,
                    and we would need 780 of them, perhaps more for redundancy in our data. These
                    smaller drives are far more expensive, however, and could easily double the
                    price of our library, even before considering redundancy. Therefore, I propose
                    that we continue with our initial idea of a central server<sup><a href="#v"
                            class="internalLink">v</a></sup>.</p>
                <p>With the web, there is the obvious opponent of outages. These come in the form of
                    power outages, warzones, and other such circumstances. Allowing patrons to
                    download certain works from the central server(s) would allow for them to access
                    their material anytime, so long as they can be the ones to provide the
                            power<sup><a href="#vi" class="internalLink">vi</a></sup>. This does
                    come at the cost of what I am to explain next as the main functionality of our
                    library, depending on which form of power the user is able to supply themselves
                    with. This functionality that I intend to be implemented is thus: the creation
                    of virtual and augmented reality deliverance systems for the works in our
                    library.</p>
                <p>Immediately, I expect some draw back from this idea. Many criticisms can be had
                    of both systems. Virtual reality is flawed in that it often does not provide us
                    with the experience we want, and, under the wrong circumstances, can leave the
                    user feeling nauseous, and turn them away from our library. Augmented reality,
                    on the other hand, is in very early stages of development, costing thousands of
                    dollars to use the most basic of setups. Many points pro et contra can be
                    created for both technologies, but, while they are in essence part of the focus
                    of this paper, we will use them just in their implementation rather than their
                    validity as such. This is not to say that we won’t allow for casual browsing in
                    the normal way via a web browser or on a local machine after said files have
                    been downloaded<sup><a href="#vii" class="internalLink">vii</a></sup><sup><a
                            href="#viii" class="internalLink">viii</a></sup>, but rather that our
                    library will endeavor to provide an immersive experience to the patrons.</p>
                <p>Firstly, in dealing with a virtual reality library, this shouldn’t be all that
                    hard to implement. Since, we are assuming, we have already created the internet
                    accessible server full of our texts, we only need to create the virtual space
                    and have the ability to turn any works located on the server into pseudo
                    physical representations. Creating the virtual world is a large, yet simple
                    task. Any of a million modelers, designers, and programmers throughout the world
                    could complete this task to a well enough degree within a few months. That is,
                    if it even took them months to do. We could implement an approach similar to
                    many creative sandbox games of today and generate the library off a few models
                    that we create<sup><a href="#ix" class="internalLink">ix</a></sup>. This
                    technique could be done probably within a few weeks, if not days with someone
                    experienced working quite hard and efficiently. Implementing virtual reality
                    controls would also be quite a simple task within the right hands. The most
                    difficult task would be the creation of an algorithm that can take any text from
                    our server and create the virtual “book” for it. Since, however, it is not our
                    purpose to discuss such algorithms, we will leave it at the discretion of
                    implementors to worry about. If, perhaps, I had more time or motivation, I could
                    easily describe in breadth the creation and implementation of such an algorithm,
                    but in order to keep this paper theoretical, I will refrain.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the creation of our augmented reality is much harder. Gone are the
                    tasks of creating virtual spaces and controls and arrived are the tasks of not
                    only generating a book layout of our texts but mapping that layout to some
                    physical real-world object<sup><a href="#x" class="internalLink">x</a></sup>. To
                    do such a thing would require our algorithm to not only generate a book preview,
                    but to do it in real time as the user looks at, hopefully, a blank page. This
                    task is significantly harder than simply creating an object of defined length
                    and width, but now we must take the length and width of what the user is looking
                    at, then generate the view off of that. If the reader ever chooses to look away,
                    we can either freeze our view once it is generated, or choose to regenerate our
                    view to whatever new, possibly blank area, that they are looking at. Perhaps to
                    me, and other inexperienced readers, this task seems quite difficult. However,
                    similar technologies have already been implemented. That is, with certain books
                    you can download an app that will grow trees, animals, and other scenery from
                    the pages. They do this via creating their algorithm to look for certain anchors
                    that help it to place the content. By delivering such an anchored and static
                    blank book to patrons, we would find ourselves with a much easier job.
                    Therefore, we can assume that this is almost certainly the route that we would
                    take. Perhaps, resources permitting, we could implement the feature to use any
                    such blank paper, making it easier for patrons without the ability to have our
                    canvas delivered to still have the ability to access our library via an
                    augmented reality. With such implementation complete, so are our
                    functionalities, and thus our library.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Now, dear reader, we have reached the conclusion of our thought experiment. I
                    leave you with the hope that such a creation will come into existence. Hope that
                    through almost infinite and widely accessible knowledge, our world might grow
                    into a new golden age. Perhaps these hopes are in vain, yet they still yield to
                    the undying mammalian emotion that is hope. If such a spark has been ignited in
                    you by reading this that you now wish to endeavor in this great library’s
                    creation, then I urge you to do so. Whether alone or with a group of disciples,
                    as long as this library is open source and open to the public upon
                            completion<sup><a href="#xi" class="internalLink">xi</a></sup>.</p>

                    money to do, once we have created our initial library, there should be, or we
                    can hope there should be, plenty of donors and investors across our wonderous
                    planet willing to help create such a wealth of information available at
                    everyone’s fingertips.</li>
                <li id="vi">Luckily, in the modern day there are plenty of ways for one person to
                    have constant, or near constant, access to their own form of power. First, there
                    is the opportunity to use any type of generator, which have been around for
                    decades now, or the increasing prevalence of solar panels, at least in the U.S..
                    Batteries in laptops and phones also, without needing constant access to power,
                    allow for users to peruse files that they have stored locally.</li>
                <li id="vii">Upon further reflection, I realize, due to how we above decided we
                    might obtain all human works, that not everything contained in our library could
                    be downloaded. This would violate some terms I am sure of licensing certain
                    works, and we might be allowed to only allow so many downloads per license, and
                    for only so long. Of course, nothing is there to say that we can stop any user
                    from screenshotting and recreating the work themselves for local storage.
                    Perhaps, a deal could be struck to allow publishers to input information about
                    where to buy a work in exchange for us “holding” it.</li>
                <li id="viii">What I mean by allowing publishers to input information is that,
                    wherever and however we allow users to access the works, perhaps on a digital
                    cover page of the work, or in the browsing list, there could be a link or
                    reference to a place that the publisher will prefer the user to buy the book
                    from if they choose to own their own copy.</li>
                <li id="ix">This technique, simply called procedural generation, is used throughout
                    the gaming industry to create random maps, quests, and items with the use of a
                    seed. Those who have taken time to learn about random number generation will
                    understand this idea better than those who have not. Since it is not the purpose
                    of this paper to explain this idea, I will instead point you to <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">this Wikipedia
                        article</a>.</li>
                <li id="x">You could make the argument that it would be easier, and therefore
                    perhaps better, to just use the generation we have from the virtual reality
                    function and leave the user with a still virtual object that they can see in
                    their home space, but I counter with the idea we are trying for the most
                    immersive experience possible, not stopping at what makes our lives easier, but
                    rather what makes the patrons happier.</li>
                <li id="xi">Sadly, however, there is no way for me to enforce that you follow this
                    advice, but on the goodness of my own heart and upon yours, dear reader, I do
                    hope you heed it.</li>
