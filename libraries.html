        <h1>On the Implications and Functionalities of Digital Libraries</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Many times, over many millennia have we lost bountiful sets of knowledge. Countless stories exist for
                the
                declines of Alexandria, Timbuktu, Pergamum, and the House of Wisdom. As a species we have gone through
                two
                identifiable dark ages, but far more information has been lost during times of light than we can track.
                Such
                examples are the governments who deem it fit to destroy, restrict, and remove books that go against
                their
                political agenda. The Nazis, Communists, and even modern-day United States. Therefore, we arrive at a
                thought
                experiment where we wish to thwart these attempts of forced arrogance.</p>
            <p>Immediately, this blog might draw parallels in your mind to works like Fahrenheit 451 and 1984. This
                isn’t
                without purpose, as in seeing the path we are apart of can encourage you to take stand and to perhaps
                engage
                in
                our universal think tank. In ways that I push you towards the above-mentioned books, I will also point
                you
                towards two resources from which I draw parts of this idea, namely <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="externalLink">The
                    Gutenberg Project</a>, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" class="externalLink">Perseus Digital Library</a>, and
                <a href="http://melvillesmarginalia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    class="externalLink">Melville’s Marginalia</a>. These resources were created for various
                reasons, but all exist as digital libraries of texts. The idea that I aim to propose here is in most
                similarity to that of The Gutenberg Project. Simply, it aims to create a
                shared library of eBooks that are accessible by all. In fact, the first eBook ever created was done by
                the
                creator of The Gutenberg Project and was of the
                United States Declaration of Independence.

        <h2>Implications</h2>
        <p>Now that I have injected the idea of a digital library into your conscious, we can begin to dissect their
            uses and how they might be of assistance in our shared dilemma. The benefits to be gained from digital
            libraries
            is simple. Once hosted on the web, a resource such as these is accessible by anyone with a connection to the
            internet. While not quite universal, this is already a large step in allowing swaths of knowledge to be
            replicated the world over and accessible by all it’s denizens.</p>
        <p>However, a few problems arise with the creation of such a tool. Firstly, we must reel in or accept the large
            scope of text that we would have to save. With quick research, we arrive at two pieces of information; the
            average size of a book is liberally estimated to be 1 MB (Megabyte) and the largest library in the world is
            The Library of Congress which contains 164 million items (Only 25 million of which are cataloged books and
            74.5
            million are manuscripts). If we take a more conservative approach and estimate that each book is instead 5
            MB, then to store the entire Library of Congress would take approximately 780 TB (Terabyte) of space. While
            to
            any layman, this seems like an incredibly large amount of data, it would account for only .000078% of
            Google’s
            estimated storage capacity. Meaning, that Google could store the human collective of literature 1.28 million
            times. So, while the task of storage is a problem for a singular person, if we take in account the abilities
            of entities, then the storage of our library becomes a cheap trick. Perhaps, however, we would like to be
            completely independent in our storage, then we could still create our own storage solution with 4 TB drives
            from Seagate for about $19,500<sup><a href="#i" class="internalLink">i</a></sup>.</p>
        <!-- There should be a footnote here after 19500 -->
        <p>The second problem that we run into is far harder to surpass. Collecting all our works and turning them into
            eBooks. All the aforementioned resources have scanned their texts so that they are simple pdf files and can
            be searched for strings of text<sup><a href="#ii" class="internalLink">ii</a></sup>. The sheer amount of persons you would need
            dedicated to this task would be insurmountable on its own, but you also must ensure that each scanned work is allowed to exist on your
            server. While it’s nice to assume every author and publisher would wish to contribute their work to the
            collective human conscious, many are greedy and would need compensation of some form. For the Perseus Digital Library
            and Melville’s Marginalia, this problem is nonexistent as all the works they contain are either out of
            copyright or are transformative enough. Gutenberg relies on the works being out of copyright or the generous donation
            of works by artists/the publishing of the books on Gutenberg. There isn’t an easy way to get around this
            problem, and the most effective way would be to take the same action as any digital library with borrowing
            features and buy licenses from the publishers.</p>
